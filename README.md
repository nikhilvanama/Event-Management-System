For a front-end website to place on GitHub for an Event Management System, you can create a user-friendly interface that allows event organizers to:

Create Events: Users can input event details, including date, time, location, and event type.

Registration and Ticketing: Implement a registration system where attendees can sign up for events and purchase tickets online.

Event Listings: Display a list of upcoming events with search and filter options, making it easy for users to discover events of interest.

Event Details: Provide detailed event pages with information about speakers, agenda, sponsors, and any other relevant details.

User Profiles: Allow users to create and manage their profiles, view their registered events, and access tickets.

Interactive Maps: Include interactive maps to help attendees find event venues easily.

Communication: Enable event organizers to send notifications and updates to registered attendees.

Feedback and Reviews: Implement a feedback and rating system to collect attendee reviews and improve future events.

Responsive Design: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices.

GitHub Repository: Host your front-end code on a GitHub repository, providing an open-source platform for collaboration and contributions from the developer community.

Remember to design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enhances the user experience for both event organizers and attendees. Additionally, you may want to integrate your front-end with a back-end system or API for full event management functionality.
